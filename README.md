# KDRAMA APPLICATION

## Updates

In our continuous effort to enhance the functionality and user experience of our website, we've made several significant updates. This document outlines the changes deployed, detailing added features, updates, and areas that still require attention.

### Added Features

- **HTML Pages for Navigation**: Added new `.html` pages to improve website navigation.

- **User Model**: A new User model has been added to our database schema. The User model includes essential attributes needed for user identification and interaction within our platform.

- **CRUD Operations for User**: Corresponding to the User model, started implemention of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

### Updates

- **Updated URLs and Settings.py**: To link up with the newly added `.html` pages, I've updated our `urls.py` and `settings.py` files. These updates ensure that our website's navigation is integrated smoothly with the backend, allowing for efficient page loading and interaction. This is still not working fully and will need to be debugged further to flesh out system.

### Ongoing and Future Work

- **Testing**: The new features and updates are still in the early stages of testing. We will need to add data to our DB to fully test features properly.

- **CRUD Operations Enhancement**: While the basic CRUD operations for the User model have been implemented, further work is necessary to ensure they work with no errors.
